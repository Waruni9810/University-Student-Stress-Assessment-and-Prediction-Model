# Stress Assessment Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict stress levels in university students based on a questionnaire. The model predicts whether students experience low, moderate, or high stress levels.

## Project Structure

- **Colab_Stress_Assessment_Model.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook where the machine learning model is developed.
- **stress_level_model.pkl**: The trained model saved as a pickle file.
- **streamlit_app/**: Contains the Streamlit app for real-time stress level predictions.
- **requirements.txt**: The Python dependencies for running the project
