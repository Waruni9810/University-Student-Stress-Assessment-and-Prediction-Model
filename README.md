# University-Student-Stress-Assessment-and-Prediction-Model
This project predicts stress levels in university students using machine learning, based on factors like academic pressure, social interactions, and career plans. It classifies stress as Low, Moderate, or High, and provides recommendations via a Streamlit app. Model development is documented in a Colab notebook.
